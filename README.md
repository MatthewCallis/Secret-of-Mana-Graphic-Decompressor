# [Secret of Mana Graphic Decompression](http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/Seiken+Densetsu+2) #

This is a reference decompressor for the Squaresoft SNES game [Secret of Mana](http://superfamicom.org/info/seiken-densetsu-2) in Ruby.

It should decompress perfectly, doesn't recompress, not optimized and probably not the best source to learn Ruby from.
